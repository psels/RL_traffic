## Description
**RL_traffic** is a reinforcement learning project focused on intelligent traffic light management to optimize urban traffic flow. This project was developed during an intensive bootcamp at **Le Wagon** in Paris by a team of four developers, each contributing equally.

The goal of the project is to leverage reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically **3DQN** (Double Deep Q-Network), to train a model that dynamically controls traffic lights based on simulated traffic conditions using **SUMO** (Simulation of Urban MObility).

## My Role
As one of the three developers, I made significant contributions to the design and implementation of the project, with the following responsibilities:
- **Development Environment Management**: Set up and customized the **SUMO** simulation environment to model urban traffic and interact with the reinforcement learning agent.
- **Reward Function Design**: Crafted reward functions to guide the agentâ€™s learning process, optimizing metrics such as reduced waiting times and improved traffic flow.
- **Model Development**: Implemented and trained reinforcement learning models using **3DQN** and **2DQN** algorithms to enhance traffic light management performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Reinforcement Learning**: 3DQN (Double Deep Q-Network), 2DQN
- **Simulation**: SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
- **Language**: Python
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## Context
This project was completed during a coding bootcamp at **Le Wagon** in Paris, where our team of three developers collaborated to design and deliver a comprehensive reinforcement learning solution. Each member contributed equally, with clear task delegation to maximize efficiency.
